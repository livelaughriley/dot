These are the dotfiles that litter my home directory. I recently wiped my harddrive, and had to reinstall everything. This happened *before I had a dotfile repo*. Aside from what was in iCloud, I lost everything: `brew` packages, `npm` packages, `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, `karabiner` config, all of my scripts, etc.

Hoping to prevent the hassle of configuring everything from scratch if I (God forbid) wipe my harddrive agian, I decided to follow the steps of many other people on GitHub and make a repo to store my dots for safe keeping.
